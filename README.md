# federated_learning_scaffold
A simple implementation of the [Scaffold - Stochastic Controlled Averaging for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06378) algorithm in Python Flower.

I have done this project as a part of [Federated Learning](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2223/FL/) course at the University of Cambridge.
